## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

This project was built using a modern, decoupled, full-stack architecture.

### **Backend (Python)**
* **Framework:** **FastAPI** for its high performance and automatic API documentation.
* **Database:** **PostgreSQL** for its robust relational data integrity.
* **ORM:** **SQLAlchemy** for powerful, object-oriented database interaction.
* **Migrations:** **Alembic** for managing the entire database schema lifecycle.
* **Authentication:** **JWT** tokens with **OAuth2** (Password Bearer flow) and `passlib` (bcrypt) for secure password hashing.
* **Data Validation:** **Pydantic** for creating clear, safe, and validated API contracts.

### **Frontend (JavaScript)**
* **Framework:** **React** (with Vite) for a fast, component-based UI.
* **State Management:** **Redux Toolkit** & **RTK Query** for centralized, efficient, and real-time server state management, including caching and optimistic updates.
* **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** & **Shadcn UI** for a utility-first, modern, and fully responsive design.
* **UI/UX:** **Framer Motion** for smooth animations and **Lucide React** for icons.
* **Notifications:** **React Hot Toast** for user-friendly feedback.

### **Architectural Highlights**
* **3-Tier Backend Architecture:** The backend is strictly organized into **API**, **Service**, and **CRUD** layers, ensuring a clean separation of concerns, high testability, and easy maintenance.
* **RESTful API Design:** The API follows professional REST principles, using a single, powerful endpoint with query parameters for filtering, sorting, and pagination.
* **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle:** Reusable components on the frontend and a modular service layer on the backend prevent code duplication and improve scalability.

### **Backend Setup**
1.  Navigate to the `Backend` directory:
    ```sh
    cd Backend
    ```
2.  Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv back
    source back/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: back\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  Install the required Python packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  Create a `.env` file in the `Backend` directory and add your database URL and a secret key:
    ```
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/fashion_db"
    SECRET_KEY="your_super_secret_key_here"
    ```
5.  Apply the database migrations:
    ```sh
    alembic upgrade head
    ```
6.  Seed the database with an admin user and initial data:
    ```sh
    python -m app.db.init_db
    ```
7.  Run the FastAPI server:
    ```sh
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```
    The backend will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
